# AsyncApp. My contribution to hype Pythons asyncio a bit more

Asyncio use is now everywhere in the Python world, ...

.. or is it?

Being there since version 3.4 my impression is, that it is still not the go to solution when starting off new projects.
It's not an obvious choice and traditional approaches still seem to be much preferred especially by beginners.

So let me take you with me on a journey to create simple, yet powerful building blocks to build asyncio based applications using patterns that are easy to follow, lightweight and attractive.
