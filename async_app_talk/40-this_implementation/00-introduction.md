TODO List:

For application **execution**:

- Run functionality concurrently
- allow long running jobs, periodically executing ones and those listening for events at the same time
- everything should be wrapped in a **task**

Regarding execution **tracing**:

- be configurably verbose
- allow some monitoring functionality to track system resources

And regarding **configuration**:

- respect suitable default settings
- allow configuration via a configuration file
- and change it via command line parameters ...
- ... or via environment variables
