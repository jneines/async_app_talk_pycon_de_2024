# Multiprocessing

**Multiprocessing** allows for execution of many things at the same time using **many processes**

- performance gain is usually as expected for both compute intense and I/O related tasks
- communication between processes can be tricky
- synchronization between processes is tricky
- loss of control might end in zombies
