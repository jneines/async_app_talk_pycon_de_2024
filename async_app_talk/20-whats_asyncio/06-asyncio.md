# Asyncio

An **asyncio** allows you to run many things using a **single thread** in a **single process**.

- performance gain only for independent tasks that are not compute intense
- concept of tasks and coroutines
- synchronizing these can be tricky
- bridging between traditional and async world is not straightforward
- usually well behaving in unexpected situations
