    "What actually needs to be done in order to run several tasks in parallel without using threads is to make them interceptable, so that Python can execute parts of every task one after another and with that emulate paralle execution. This strategy is fine for many tasks.\n",

    "So how does it work? \n",

    "Basically we need to tell the iinterpreter, that a function execution needs to be treated differently, that there is places in the code, where execution can be intercepted. That's where the `async` keyword is for.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thr result of both is exactly the same. Ones nature is blocking though, whilst the other allows interception to execute something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally you need a `runner` to execute the `async awaitables`. That's where `asyncio.run` comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at a very simple example with a blocking implementation that can be broken up to allow concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to transform a blocking `time.sleep` being just a simple placeholder for other more complex work with a blocking nature, into something that still executes the same blocking code, but allows things to happen in parallel."
