# The problem

- I've created several applications for all of these over the years
- Regarding their architecture, they are basically all very comparable
- Wait for events and act upon them
- Perform actions periodically

- All implementations varied although they were meant to do similar things
- Complexity of implementations grew rapidly over time
- Maintaining became more difficult

Something had to change! ...
