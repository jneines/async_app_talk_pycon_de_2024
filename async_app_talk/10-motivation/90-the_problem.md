# The problem

- I've created **several** applications for all of these over the years.
- Regarding their architecture, they are basically all **very comparable**.
- They all **wait for events** and **act** upon them, 
- or perform actions **periodically**.

- All **implementations varied** although they were meant to do similar things.
- **Complexity** of implementations **grew rapidly** over time.
- **Maintaining** became more **difficult**.

**Something had to change! ...**
