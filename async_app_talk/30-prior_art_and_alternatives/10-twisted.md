# Twisted

> Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. It includes modules for many different purposes. 
>
> Twisted supports all major system event loops -- select (all platforms), poll (most POSIX platforms), epoll (Linux), kqueue (FreeBSD, macOS), IOCP (Windows), and various GUI event loops (GTK+2/3, Qt, wxWidgets). Third-party reactors can plug into Twisted, and provide support for additional event loops.
